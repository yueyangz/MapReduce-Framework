No

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  (include detailed instructions, or write 'None')

You can do ant build, and then ant worker. This will start the worker nodes 
at 8001. However, since I used Tomcat, I do not have a servlet container
 included in the solution. The servlet class will run on Tomcat normally.
You can either start Tomcat on command line or in Eclipse. 
Jetty should work, too
